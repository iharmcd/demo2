How long I have wanted
This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can?t believe I?m through

I´ve tried, oh
How I´ve tried
For a life, yes a life
I thought I knew

Oh it´s the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it´s worth it to carry on
'Cause it´s a game we gotta lose
Though it´s a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it´s done

Time seems to have frozen
But the mind can be fooled
As the days passed I discovered
Destiny just can´t be ruled
